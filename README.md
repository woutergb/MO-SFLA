# MO-SFLA
MATLAB implementation of shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) on multi-objective optimisation (MOO) test problems. Was used to test the performance of the MO SFLA against the multi-objective optimisation cross-entropy method (MOO CEM) as part of final year undergraduate project in 2012 at Stellenbosch University.
